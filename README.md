# HR_attrition_model
Step by step data science to predict voluntary attrition

**About this project:**
As a HR professional with 15 years of experience, I have worked on a range of projects across geographies and business functions.  In a sense, it all comes back to one practical question.  Are we able to sense the underlying causes of the outcomes we are observing, and if so, can we do something about them before they become a problem? 

The project in front of me is a requirement from the business to look at the causes of voluntary attrition, and determine the root causes.  The code provided here is an attempt to answer this question for my business.  I have adjusted the data so that it is business agnostic, and does not reveal any sensitive insights about our business model, but I hope that the methodology will be useful to other HR practitioners like myself - people who want to use practical data science steps to help influence decisions and outcomes in their own organiztion.
