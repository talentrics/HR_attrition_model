# HR_attrition_model
Step by step data science to predict voluntary attrition

**About this project:**
As a HR professional with 15 years of experience, I understand the challenges HR professionals face to be more consultative than operational.  One question most HR professionals face is to build an understanding of the factors that influence atttrition within their organization.  I recently used a data science approach to weigh the importance of various indicators that I had access to from HR records.  This project is an overview of how I was able to build a predictive model that predicts with 90% accuracy the profile of employees who are more likely to leave the organization.
