# HR_attrition_model
Step by step data science to predict voluntary attrition

**About this project:**
As a HR professional with 15 years of experience, I understand the challenges HR professionals face to be more consultative than operational.  I recently used a data science approach to weigh the importance of various indicators that I had access to from HR records, and thought it might be useful to others.  Below is a step by step of how I was able to predict voluntary exits using a 'supervised' machine learning approach.  It was able to predict with 90% accuracy the profile of employees who are more likely to leave the organization.  Please be sure to read to the end, where I also address the quesiton of data ethics in this approach.

**Steps to build & test a predictive model**

All data & code for this model has been privatized and generalized so that it is not a reflection of my actual results for my own company.  I have shared the code and updated data source in the Google Colab Notebook in the Github repository.
