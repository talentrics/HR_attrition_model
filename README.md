# HR_attrition_model
Step by step data science to predict voluntary attrition

**About this project:**
As a HR professional with 15 years of experience, I have worked on a range of projects across geographies and business functions.  In a sense, it all comes back to one practical question.  Are we able to sense the underlying causes of the outcomes we are observing, and if so, can we do something about them before they become a problem? 
In this spirit, I am focused today on building a people analytics function is a rapidly growing organization.  Part of my mission is to bring data science 'insights' and apply them to the more personal, qualitative aspects of managing people.  One of these quesitons is how we differentiate healthy attrition from 'regretted' attrition.  The costs of not pre-emptively taking action on the latter, and how we might be able to do so even if we wanted to.
